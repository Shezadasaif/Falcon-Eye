# 🚨 Falcon Eye - Advanced Monitoring Tool (Educational Use Only)

**Falcon Eye** is an advanced monitoring and reconnaissance simulation tool, developed exclusively for **ethical hacking training**, **cybersecurity awareness**, and **educational research**.

This tool demonstrates how surveillance systems may function in controlled, educational environments using ethical and safe methods.

---

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is built **only for educational and ethical use**. Misuse for unauthorized spying, hacking, or surveillance is strictly prohibited. The developer is **not responsible for any illegal activity**. Always follow local cyber laws and get proper permission before any test.

## 🔐 License Key Protection

To prevent misuse, Falcon Eye is secured with a **license key system**.

- ✅ A default key is already set in the tool.
- 🔑 You must enter the correct key on first launch.
- 🔐 The tool exits if an incorrect key is entered — preventing unauthorized use.
